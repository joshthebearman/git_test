  <h1>My Story</h1>
  <img src="img/profilepic.jpg">
  <p>My name is Joshua Johnson</p>
  <p>I was born in Southern California, but I grew up in a small town in Texas</p>
  <p>I went to University at Oklahoma Baptist University in Shawnee, Oklahoma, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy.</p>
  <p>I've heard every joke about Philosophy majors, and make quite a few myself, but we are not to be underestimated. If you hire a philosophy major, you can look forward to adding these <em>essential skills</em> to your team.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Critical Thinking</li>
    <li>Logical, Anaylitical Problem Solving</li>
    <li>The Ability to See Other Perspectives</li>
    <li>Great communication</li>
    <li>Jokes about Immanuel Kant that you won't understand.</li>
  </ul>
